# Drag & Drop w/ React

This project uses [react-beautiful-dnd]() to drag & drop items between lists. It is a simple example made to get the gist of how drag & drop might work in a larger project.

## Run Stuff
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
